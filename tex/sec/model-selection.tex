		Figures \ref{sfig:calib-soc}, \ref{sfig:calib-n} and \ref{sfig:calib-ph} in appendix \ref{sec:parameters} show the selected wavelengths included in the corresponding models highlighted in grey against the spectra from figure \ref{fig:soil-spec-rnd}.
		One notes that the density of selected lightwaves varies strongly along the wavelengths for all three response variables, where $p^{(\m{SOC})}$ uses the most and $\m{pH}$ the lowest amount of predictors.
		
		For $p^{(\m{SOC})}$ and $p^{(\m{N})}$, we find that similar regions seeminlgy relevant for prediction, albeit the predictors for $p^{(\m{N})}$ appear to be slightly more evenly distributed along the whole domain of measured wavelengths. %Is that the correct term?.
		In the selected model for $p^{(\m{SOC})}$, predictors are highly concentrated in the regions from 1550 - 1650 $\unit{nm}$, 1790 - 1810 $\unit{nm}$, 1980 - 1990 $\unit{nm}$, around 2500 $\unit{nm}$ and between 2600 and 2672 $\unit{nm}$.
		
		The distribution of predictors for the $\m{pH}$ appears to be visibly distinct from the other two models.
		In particular, the lower-middle wavelengths seem to have more predictive power than for $p^{(\m{SOC})}$ and $p^{(\m{N})}$.
		
		Appendix \ref{sec:parameters} hosts the tables with the estimated parameters for the predictors for each model.
		It is noteworthy to inspect the values of the intercepts for each model.
%		We find that these appear relatively close to 0 in case of $p^{\m{(SOC)}}$ and $p^{\m{(N)}}$.
		The $\m{pH}$ again sticks out as the value for its intercept is clearly placed in a mildly acidic range. % black coffee range ;)

	\subsection{Goodness of Fit}
	\label{ssec:suitability}
	
		Figure \ref{fig:gof} displays the correlation diagrams introduced in \ref{ssec:model-validation} for each response variable together with the values for the $R^2$.
		Both indicate that our estimation and model selection to predict $\m{pH}$ are working best.
		Taking measurement error into account, an $R^2 = 0.940$ shows a good accordance between predictions by the model and the actual observed values.
		The clear pattern in diagram \ref{sfig:gof-ph} corroborates these findings.
		
		We have already seen on several occasions that $\m{pH}$ has to be treated slighted different from the other two response variables.
		The usual divergence between the patterns for the $\m{pH}$ and the other two response variables emerges here as well.
		$p^{\m{(SOC)}}$ and $p^{\m{(N)}}$ display not only lower values for $R^2$, but their correlation diagrams indicate a coherent divergence from the $\id$.
		
		Our predictions seem to underestimate the observed values for the upper third of the observed interval.
		This could be due to a lack of data, which are considerably scarcer in that region than in the regions where the fits appear good.
		Only less than 5 \% of the whole measurements lie in the upper tiers of both response variables.
		
		Another reason might be that the linear assumption is misplaced, by judging from the visual aspects of the scatter plot alone.
		As we have strong reason to maintain the linear hypothesis (\ref{ssec:nirs}) and taking into account that for most values the correlation seems even better than in the case of $\m{pH}$, we maintain that it is safe to assume higher measurement errors in as $p^{\m{(SOC)}}$ and $p^{\m{(N)}}$ increase, which in turn contributes to lower $R^2$ values.
		In sum, there is not sufficient evidence to reject the selected and estimated models at this point.
