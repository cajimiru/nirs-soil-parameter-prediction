	The true $\m{SPSE}$ for all simulations is $172.85$. Applying the model selection algorithm to 1000 pseudo-observations of $p^{(\m{SOC})}$, we find that we underestimate the true $\m{SPSE}$ by a margin of $20.22$. 
	This is more than one standard deviation below the true value.
	As we decrease the number of used observations, this difference becomes increasingly and monotonously steeper as shown in the first column of table \ref{tab:sim-res}.

	% report the results on the $\m{SPSE} - \widehat{\m{SPSE}} | m$
	Reducing the resolution in contrast leads to overestimation of the $\m{SPSE}$.
	Again, the difference between mean estimated $\m{SPSE}$ and the true value is here monotone and increasing as can be seen in the first row of table \ref{tab:sim-res}.
	
	It is interesting to see that the standard deviation (and hence the variance) is increasing in $m$ but decreasing in $n$.
	Albeit the estimates for the $\m{SPSE}$ differ strongly, standard the deviation remains rather stable and within a close band around $12.5 \pm 3$
	
	The closest approximation to the true $\m{SPSE}$ is reached at 400 measurements and at a resolution of only a third of the original one.
	This indicates a strong dependence of the calibration on the original measuring setup.
