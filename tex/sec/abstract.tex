We describe and assess a procedure to construct and calibrate predictive models in NIRS measurements applied to three different response variables in soil samples.
Constructing linear models from known physical and chemical properties, we calibrate them with respect to included predictors by formulation of a discrete minimisation problem based on Mallow's $C_\m{p}$.
Using SANN to solve the minimisation problem, we then assess the effects of two hyperparameters, resolution and training set size, on the method's perfrmance.
