We describe and assess a procedure to construct and calibrate predictive models to be used in NIRS for three different response variables.
Constructing general models from known physical and chemical properties, we calibrate them with respect to included predictors and parameters through the formulation of a non-convex discrete minimisation problem.
Using SANN to solve the minimisation problem, we then assess the overall performance and the effects of the hyperparameters, resolution and training set size, on the results of our algorithm.
