	problem:
		☐	introduction: paper -> report
		☐	background/soil parameters: molar concentration c_A >>of A<<
		☐	background/nirs: space after comma
		☐	background/nirs: first paragraph not sounds right
		☐	background/nirs: wavelength lambda with set definition
		☐	background/nirs: beer-lambert law as approximation
		☐	methodology/statistical model: >> k<n <<
		☐	methodology/mlr: first sentence with three >>and<<
		☐	methodology/mlr: redefine sigma² for realization
		☐	methodology/cp: check variance of parameters for overfitting argument
		☐	methodology/cp: merits?
		☐	methodology/cp: reference to definitions of last section (esp: sigma²)
		☐	methodology/cp: the minimization >>of<< this...
		☐	methodology/cp: check estimated spse in brackets (where is the M)
		☐	methodology/cp: delete last funny sentence
		☐	methodology/sa: refer to the last sections for definitions
		☐	methodology/sa: condition n-k<k with citation, context not clear
		☐	methodology/sa: hypothesis space H makes no sense at this point
		☐	methodology/sa: what is best k?
		☐	methodology/sa: we do not compare two methods
		☐	methodology/sa: inequation does not hold in our method; computing is beyond feasibility, so we want to find a good local minimum
		☐	methodology/sa: change rnd function description
		☐	methodology/mv: R² measure -> R²-measure
		☐	methodology/mv: refer to last definitions
		☐	methodology/mv: every variable has to be defined: M,arithmetic mean, maybe second definition of R²
		☐	methodology/simulation: spse est. needs the M
		☐	methodology/simulation: second paragraph not clear (definitions), why using 1000?, what is C^(j), what is ...
		☐	methodology/simulation: pseudo generation: hat{Y} -> hat{y}, equations in one line
		☐	methodology/simulation: redefine variance estimator
		☐	methodology/simulation: Lambda^(m): use cdot (lambda does not have two indices)
		☐	methodology/simulation: too complicated definition of random subsets and other predictor subsets
		☐	implementation/can: use only one: nbr-function, nbr function
		☐	implementation/can: change set of r to {1,...,k} (intercept is 0)
		☐	implementation/can: where is the listing?
		☐	implementation/pre: check second paragraph
		☐	implementation/pre: X^M is full rank (right), place for stating full rank of X
		☐	implementation/pre: reformat equation system
		☐	implementation/pre: inverse of sigma²
		☐	ms/calibration: beslightly -> be slightly
		☐	ms/calibration: introduction to the selected model too short
		☐	ms/calibration: bandwidth is not the right term
		☐	ms/calibration: intercepts are not 0 for soc and n
		☐	ms/gof: figure caption: blue in small letters
		☐	ms/gof: corroborate?
		☐	ms/gof: maybe no new paragraph at the end? 
		☐	simulation/cs: again problem spse
